## This repository stores three code examples prepared for course CE597 at Penn State.
### 1. The code "Q-learning_maze.ipynb" uses Q-learning to solve a simple maze problem
The maze size is 3*3. 
### 2. The code "Policy_Based_RL_CartPole.ipynb" uses REINFORCE to solve the cart-pole problem.
The environment is a cart-pole, a classical environment in OpenAI's gym. This example demonstrates how to use a policy-based RL to solve problems.
### 3. The code "PPO_CartPole_Training.ipynb" uses PPO to solve the cart-pole problem.
This example demonstrates how to simply apply RL packages, here I use stable-baslines3, to solve a problem.
